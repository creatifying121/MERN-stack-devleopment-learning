    <!-- flexbox : it is a great way to get more flexibility in layouts to simplify responsive design. it makes it easy to align elements on a 2d plane and is pretty easy to use once we get familiar with the main properties.
    
    it is a 1-d layout model, through which we can distribute space and we can use its alignment capabilities.

    the first step is to set display: flex on a "container" element. the "children to the flex" container are called "flex items". A set of properties can be applied to flex containers and have an effect to all the items as a whole, and a different set of properties can be applied to flex items and have their effect on the targeted items. flex items can in turn also be flex containers for the elements it contains, making it easy to create complex layouts.

    <!-- flex properties of parents -->
    <!-- <div class="container">
        <div class="box">box-1</div>
        <div class="box">box-2</div>
        <div class="box">box-3</div>
        <div class="box">box-4</div>
    </div> -->


    <!-- flex-items properties (for children) -->
    <div class="container">
        <div class="box" id="box1">box1</div>
        <div class="box" id="box2">box2</div>
        <div class="box" id="box3">box3</div>
        <div class="box" id="box4">box4</div>
