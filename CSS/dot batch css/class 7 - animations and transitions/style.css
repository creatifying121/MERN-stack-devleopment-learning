/* functions in css
   we have seen following functions before:
   rgb(), rgba(), repeat(), scale(), trnaslate(), minmax(), gradient(), etc.
*/

/* calc() function */
/* if we create a layout, where we want margin left to be 10% and top to be 5%. this function can use operators like +,-,* and / and we can provide values accordingly

width: calc(100% -50px)
height: min(50%, 400px)

minmax() => we used this with grid, property grid-auto-rows (when we don't know how many rows can be there on a page) so whenever new rows will be created, they will be assigned a size of minmax(min_height, max_height)
